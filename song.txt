I hit my head real hard, I woke up in a jar
On top of his blue metal shelf full of trinkets
He'd dust me off each day, I'm made of porcelain clay
I feed him kisses so I don't break down to pieces

And now he's hungry, I'll feed him candy
You're screamin' at me loud, screamin' at me loud, screamin' at me loud

finish my song
